This Unity project serves as a learning resource for students who are new to multiplayer development using Unity Netcode for GameObjects (NGO). It provides simple, well-structured examples of player spawning, movement synchronization, UI-based session creation/joining, and basic client–server communication. The goal is to offer a reference project that students can open, explore, and build upon as they learn core networking concepts and best practices.

Some aspects are adapted from the Unity Netcode Widgets package.
